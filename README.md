# Polling

application that takes a poll for 5 different topics from 10 different users

**_Polling program_**

This program was completed after I read chapter 8: Arrays: and introduction to exception handling.
The first little project to do with a data structure so thats nice. The biggest take away I got from This
assignment was the spacing I didn't know how to do that in c# until this chapter. figuring out the right alightments
was kind of fun. This program is a simple survey that ask the user to rate each topic from 1 - 10 (10 being the most important).
Afterwards it just gives you a survey of the information such as the average rating for each topic,
the topics with the highest and lowest total points as well.I also haven't had much experience using multidimensional arrays in exercies/projects
so I found that kind of fun as well.

How to use:
Compile and run the program. the program will print out each topic there are 5 topics you rate them 1-10. So its to simulate 10 different users so it collects
50 responses overall.
